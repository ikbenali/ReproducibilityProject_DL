# ReproducibilityProject_DL

This repository concerns the Reproducibility of the paper: When and why PINNs fail to train: A neural tangent kernel perspective (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14527) 

This project is a mandatory assignment for the CS4240:Deep Learning course at Delft University of Technology.

For this project in particular, an attempt is done to reproduce Fig 1. and Fig 2. using the same model problem (Poisson 1D) with the Pytorch framework.
