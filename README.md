# ReproducibilityProject_DL

This repository concerns the Reproducibility project, of the CS4240 Deep Learning course CS4240:Deep Learning course at Delft University of Technology, of the paper: When and why PINNs fail to train: A neural tangent kernel perspective (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14527). For this project the aim to reproduce Fig 1. and Fig 2. using the same model problem (Poisson 1D) with the Pytorch framework.

In addition, the adaptive algorithm proposed in the paper has been tested and also observed on another new problem; Viscious Burger's Equation
